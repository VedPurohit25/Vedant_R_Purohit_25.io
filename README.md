* 🚀 Enhanced Project Descriptions

AI-Powered E-commerce with Product Recommendation 
The Problem: Traditional text-based search often fails to capture specific visual styles a customer is looking for.
The Solution: Developed a deep-learning system using ResNet and TensorFlow that allows users to find products through image similarity.
Key Tech: Python, TensorFlow, Streamlit, ResNet.
Result: Created a seamless interface where AI provides real-time product suggestions based on visual features.
E-commerce Website Clone 
The Goal: Master the architecture of modern online storefronts.
The Execution: Built a fully responsive front-end using HTML5 and CSS3, focusing on clean navigation and user experience (UX) principles.
Key Tech: HTML, CSS.
Interactive Piano Player 
The Goal: Implement complex event handling and DOM manipulation.
The Execution: Created a web-based musical instrument that responds to both mouse clicks and keyboard inputs with low-latency audio playback.
Key Tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
